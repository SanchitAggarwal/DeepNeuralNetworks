# DeepNeuralNetworks
A python based Deep Neural Network - A "copy-paste" effort from Matlab  (rasmusbergpalm matlab code) to Python.
I have been learning about Python and Deep Learning. To fully understand the inners workings of Deep Neural Networks, 
I decided to translate the Matlab code from https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox to Python.

Note you are free to update this code and submit fixes. It is a code purely written for educational purpose. 
If you are stuck at hefty packages like caffe, cuda, torch , tensorflow and feel lost with deep neural networks, 
then the matlab version of the code or this python version is where you should start.

This is currently a work in progress. I will be comitting codes as soon as they are stable. 
Please note that I have tried as much as possible to produce a "Copy-Paste" version of the code, despite that, you will find many code differences. Like handling of overlfows, logs, exponentials and classes. 

I hope you will enjoy using the code as much as I enjoyed translating it :)

# Note on code Translations
I have tried my best to keep the code in more a understanable way. I know there are various functions that could have been done more clean in a more pythonic
way, but that does not serve the purpose of a clear code understanding. I have also tried my best to develop the code that is close to matlab in terms of accuracy.
