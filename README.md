# DeepNeuralNetworks
A python based Deep Neural Network - A copy-paste effort from Matlab  (rasmusbergpalm matlab code) to Python
I have been learning about Python and Deep Learning. To fully understand the inners workings of Deep Neural Networks, 
I decided to translate the Matlab code from https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox to Python.

Note you are free to update this code and submit fixes. It is a code purely written for educational purpose. 
If you hare stuck at hefty packages like caffe, cuda, torch , tensorflow and feel lost with deep neural networks, 
then the matlab version of the code or this python version is where you should start
